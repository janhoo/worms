## retriving Aphia information from World Register of Marine Species (www.marinespecies.org) using [WoRMSÂ´](http://www.marinespecies.org) RESTful Webservice


This repository provides methods to scrape taxonomic information from 
WoRMS. 
Use it to check taxonimic information against the WoRMS repository.
Add the respective \emph{valid} taxons to your taxonimic dataset and for each taxon amend the Aphia ID of the currently  \emph{accepted} taxon, which is not neccessarily identical to the \emph{valid Aphia id}
